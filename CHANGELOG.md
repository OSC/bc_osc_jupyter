  [#55](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/55).

## [0.16.2] - 2020-10-09
### Fixed
- When using Zoom on an iPad and 'sharing content' through a url, we do not
  pass form parameters to the login API in a new tab. So, we don't open a new
  tab if the user agent is Zoom in an iPad. [54](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/54).

## [0.16.1] - 2020-09-21
### Fixed
- PR [52](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/52) 0.16.0 bug fixes
  - fixed scheduling hugemem nodes on owens

## [0.16.0] - 2020-09-21
### Changed
- PR [52](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/52) pitzer-exp merged into
  the pitzer cluster
  - Removed pitzer-exp as an option.
  - Created new node type pitzer options to accomidate pitzer-exp merging into
    pitzer
  - Changed the help text for node types
  - logic for handling submitting blank cores is again in the submit.yml.erb
    instead of the javascript.

## [0.15.0] - 2020-08-27
### Added
- support for owens, pitzer and pitzer expansion clusters
  - Added javascript to toggle the select options (node_type and cuda_version
    availability are different across clusters).
  - PR [46](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/46) merged
    this app with pitzer
  - PR [48](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/48) added
    the pitzer expansion cluster

### Changed
- javascript now populates the num_cores if it's blank (instead of populating
  in the submit.yml.erb).
- min cores is 1 instead of 0.
- A hash of common_kernels were added to the script.sh.erb that exist on any
  cluster. Owens specific kernels merge with this hash.
- many form items now have data attributes for js to read and manipulate.

## [0.14.2] - 2020-08-26
### Added
- classrooms set FACLs so that instructors and teaching assistants can access
  the users' files to grade them.

## [0.14.1] - 2020-08-19
### Changed
- removed the "c.JupyterApp.config_file_name = 'ondemand_config'" configuration
  because it can conflict with extensions (notably nbgrader)
- make the class directory even if there's nothing to copy to it
- touch a MD file in the classroom root directory for reference and note taking
- classrooms specify NOTEBOOK_ROOT to start in that directory and encapsulate the
  classroom environment instead of relying on the JUPYTER_API redirecting to the
  directory

### Added
- classrooms create a MD file in the root directory for reference and to keep
  notes.

## [0.14.0] - 2020-08-12
### Added
- classroom flag. When enabled we copy files from the environment variable 
  $OSC_CLASS_FILES to ~/osc_classes/$OSC_CLASS_ID to initialize the classroom
  envrionment [#44](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/44).

### Changed
- Simplified the way we toggle the visibility of GPU node choice and the
  text field choice for CUDA version [#43](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter/pull/43).

## [0.13.3] - 2020-06-26
### Fixed
- Notebooks use the corret /tree API and Lab uses /lab

## [0.13.2] - 2020-06-25
### Fixed
- Default workspace url is '/lab' not '/lab/workspaces/lab'

## [0.13.1] - 2020-06-22
### Fixed
- Gitlab CI so that it gets pushed to dev automatically

## [0.13.0] - 2020-06-22
### Fixed
- A bug Safari users run into that complains about the workspace being already in use.
  Though this bug actuall applies to Pitzer and not the older Owens version.

### Changed
- The JupyterLab versions available. Previously only 1 version was available (0.34). Now
  users can choose between version 0.36, 1.2 and 2.1.  And all work correctly.
- Changed the workspaces directory to accomidate Safari users.

## [0.12.1] - 2020-01-27
